This could relate to the pKa of NH4, which is roughly 9 and would be protonated. Kegg doesn't use NH4OH, but instead splits this reaction up into NH3 and H20, which makes more sense to me. NH4OH pKa is 3.3 at 18 Centigrade per wiki and would be deprotonated. Another recommended change is conforming to the kegg database reaction from 1.7.1.4 or 1.7.1.15. Both are ambigous as per Kegg. Two reactions are basically the same but one uses NADPH and the other uses NADH. Basic biology says that NADPH is primarily in anabolic reactions in plants, but may be used in bacteria.
